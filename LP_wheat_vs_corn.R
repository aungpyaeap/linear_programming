# A farmer in Iowa owns 450 acres of land. He is going to plant each acre with wheat or corn.
# Each acre planted with wheat yields $2000 profit, requires three workers, and requires two tons of fertilizer.
# Each acre planted with corn yields $3000 profit, requires two workers, and requires four tons of fertilizer.
# There are currently 1000 workers and 1200 tons of fertilizer available. 
# a. Use Solver to help the farmer maximize the profit from his land.
# b. Confirm graphically that the solution from part a maximizes the farmerâ€™s profit from his land.
# c. Use SolverTable to see what happens to the decision variables and the total profit when the availability of fertilizer varies from 200 tons to 2200 tons in 100-ton increments.
# When does the farmer discontinue producing wheat? When does he discontinue producing corn? How does the profit change for each 10-ton increment?
